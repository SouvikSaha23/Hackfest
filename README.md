An app that can change the experience of shopping in malls.</br>
</br>
We all have experienced long chekout queues at malls which sometimes costs more time than our shopping time.
This app addresses that problem.</br></br>
It provides an iterface which enables the customers in the mall to just purchase their goods with the help of their phones. 
The user will need to scan the QR code of the mall to connect the app to the database of the mall. Now they just need to scan the 
barcode of the items. The item details will automatically be added to the cart in the app. They can choose multiple items or remove selected
items from their cart.</br></br>
Once the shopping is done they can directly pay for the purchases by using the chekout feature which allows them to make transactions 
online via a payment gateway. The total amount will be deducted from their bank account.
